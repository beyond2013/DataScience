    "## What is scikit-learn (sklearn) — and what is a Pipeline?\n",
    "\n",
    "### scikit-learn (sklearn)\n",
    "- **scikit-learn** is a very popular Python library for machine learning.  \n",
    "- It provides easy-to-use tools for:\n",
    "  - preprocessing data (imputing missing values, scaling, encoding),\n",
    "  - training many kinds of models (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.),\n",
    "  - evaluating models (cross-validation, metrics), and\n",
    "  - searching for good hyperparameters (GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV).  \n",
    "- scikit-learn follows a simple and consistent **estimator API**:\n",
    "  - `fit(X, y)` — learn from training data, producing model parameters,\n",
    "  - `predict(X)` — make predictions,\n",
    "  - `predict_proba(X)` — (for classifiers) return class probabilities,\n",
    "  - `transform(X)` — (for transformers) return a transformed version of X,\n",
    "  - `fit_transform(X, y)` — shorthand to fit then transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a `Pipeline` and why use it?\n",
    "A **Pipeline** chains multiple processing steps into a single object. Each step is either:\n",
    "- a **transformer** (has `fit` and `transform`) — e.g., `SimpleImputer`, `StandardScaler`, `OneHotEncoder`, or  \n",
    "- an **estimator** (has `fit` and `predict`) — e.g., `LogisticRegression`, `DecisionTreeClassifier`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why pipelines are useful (big benefits):**\n",
    "1. **Cleaner code.** You write preprocessing + model once and treat it like a single object.  \n",
    "2. **No data leakage.** When you `fit` the pipeline on the training set, transformers compute statistics (mean, median, etc.) only from the training data — those same fitted transformers are then applied to the test data. This prevents accidentally leaking information from test into training.  \n",
    "3. **Works with cross-validation and GridSearchCV.** You can pass the whole pipeline to `cross_val_score` or `GridSearchCV`. This makes sure preprocessing is done inside each fold correctly.  \n",
    "4. **Easier hyperparameter tuning.** You can tune preprocessing or model hyperparameters via one `param_grid` by using step names (see example below).\n"

    "## 2) K fold Cross-Validation (CV)\n",
    "Cross-validation splits the training set into k folds. Each fold acts as validation once.\n",
    "StratifiedKFold preserves class proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is StratifiedKFold?\n",
    "🔹 The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use cross-validation, we split the dataset into several folds (e.g. 5 or 10 parts).\n",
    "Each fold is used once as a test set while the others are used for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the dataset is imbalanced (for example, in the Titanic dataset there are fewer survivors than non-survivors), a normal KFold split might put too many survivors in one fold and too few in another.\n",
    "\n",
    "That would make the model’s accuracy vary a lot between folds — not a fair test of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 The Solution → StratifiedKFold\n",
    "\n",
    "**StratifiedKFold is a special kind of K-Fold cross-validation that keeps the class distribution the same in every fold.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each fold has roughly the same ratio of survivors and non-survivors as the original dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives a more reliable and stable estimate of how well your model performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visual Example (Titanic Dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say in the Titanic dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 65% passengers didn’t survive (y=0)\n",
    "- 35% passengers survived (y=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "When using StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5), each of the 5 folds will also maintain about 65:35 ratio between 0s and 1s.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you used plain KFold, some folds might accidentally have 80% non-survivors and 20% survivors, leading to biased evaluation."

    "## 3) Preprocessing + Logistic Regression Pipeline\n",
    "We build a ColumnTransformer + Pipeline to preprocess numeric/categorical features and train LogisticRegression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why We Need Scaling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Different features often have different units and ranges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age might range from 0 to 80\n",
    "- Fare might range from 0 to 500\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though both are numeric, the Fare values are much larger.\n",
    "This can confuse many machine learning algorithms (like Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM), which assume all features are on a comparable scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we standardize them to make them “look similar” numerically — without changing what they represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How StandardScaler Works?\n",
    "\n",
    "The StandardScaler transforms each numeric column separately using this formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$z = \\frac{x - mean}{standard deviation}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So for each feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It finds the mean (average) value.\n",
    "- Subtracts the mean from each data point (centers it around 0).\n",
    "- Divides by the standard deviation (spreads it so typical values are around -1 to +1).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "| Passenger | Age | Fare |\n",
    "|------------|-----|------|\n",
    "| A | 20 | 50 |\n",
    "| B | 40 | 100 |\n",
    "| C | 60 | 200 |\n",
    "\n",
    "For each column separately:\n",
    "\n",
    "Age column: mean = 40, std = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "New values: (20−40)/20 = −1, (40−40)/20 = 0, (60−40)/20 = +1\n",
    "\n",
    "Fare column: mean = 116.7, std = 62.3\n",
    "\n",
    "New values: (50−116.7)/62.3 = −1.07, (100−116.7)/62.3 = −0.27, (200−116.7)/62.3 = +1.34\n",
    "\n",
    "After scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Passenger | Age_scaled | Fare_scaled |\n",
    "|------------|-------------|--------------|\n",
    "| A | −1.0 | −1.07 |\n",
    "| B | 0.0 | −0.27 |\n",
    "| C | +1.0 | +1.34 |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Both columns now have mean ≈ 0 and standard deviation ≈ 1,\n",
    "so neither dominates the model just because it had larger numbers."
