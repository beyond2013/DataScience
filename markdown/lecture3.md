# Descriptive Statistics

## Introduction

- Descriptive Statistics helps to simplify large amounts of data
- present quantitative descriptions of data
- it is based on two main concepts:
  - population: a collection of objects, items about which information is sought
	- sample: a part of the population that is observed
- Descriptive Statistics forms the basis of every quantitative analysis of data
- It generates different statistics to describe and summarize the data concisely and evaluate different ways to visualize them.

## Data Preparation

- one of the first tasks when analyzing data is to collect and prepare the data in a format appropriate for analysis of the samples.
- Most common steps for data preparation involve the following operations:

1. Obtaining the data: Data can be read directly from a file or they might be obtained by scrapping the web.
2. Parsing the data: the right parsing procedure depends on what format the data are in: plain text, fixed columns, CSV, XML, HTML etc.
3. cleaning the data: Survey responses and other data files are almost always incomplete and full of errors. A strategy to handle such data is required.
4. Building data structures: Once you read the data, it is necessary to store them in a data structure that lends itself to the analysis we are interested in.
**If the data fit into the memory**, building a data structure is usually the way to go. **If not**, usually a database is build, which is an out-of-memory data structure.
